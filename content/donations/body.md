t2bot.io is completely free to use, though donations are graciously appreciated to help offset
the cost of operating. Hosting your projects on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/d2b21b8d9270) with
our link helps lower the cost for some of t2bot.io's services, such as integrations and the media
repository.
