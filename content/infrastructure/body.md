# Infrastructure

t2bot.io consists of multiple servers which all work to host bots, bridges, and other things for people to use. All servers have a gigabit network connection to the internet and use SSD (or faster)
storage. Media (images, etc) is stored in DigitalOcean Spaces (s3-like service). Questions about the hardware t2bot.io runs on are best asked in [#help:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io).
