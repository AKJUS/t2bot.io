# Haiku Bot

When messages look like they fit in the haiku format, this bot does that.

The source code for the bot is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-haiku-bot).


## Using the bot

1. Invite [@haiku:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@haiku:t2bot.io) to your room.
2. Send a message which would fit into the haiku format.
