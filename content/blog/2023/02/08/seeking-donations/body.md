# t2bot.io seeking donations

<small><i>February 8th, 2023 by TravisR</i></small>

Hey all,

Since 2017, [t2bot.io](https://t2bot.io/) has provided communities on Matrix bots and bridges to use for free, and while thereâ€™s no plan to charge for access, the cost of running the service is about $12k USD/year just to exist.

Since August 2020, t2bot.ioâ€™s primary source of funding has been from the Matrix.org Foundation, though with the Foundationâ€™s latest focus on raising funds for itself, it feels like the right thing to do is get t2bot.io independently funded.

**If you are able, please donate to t2bot.io [here](https://t2bot.io/donations/).** All donations go towards the cost of operation, with any excess (if t2bot.io is so luckyâ€¦) going towards hiring developers to work on/build bridges as well as into the Foundation to thank them for keeping t2bot.io online all these years.

Currently, t2bot.io serves _86 thousand_ Discord and Telegram communities, bridging 325 thousand users _each month_, and _11.3 million_ users since 2017. Thereâ€™s also 962 thousand rooms with a t2bot.io user in them, leaving only about 94 thousand rooms as archived, across 25 thousand different homeservers.

Operating at this scale requires, well, $12k USD per year: if youâ€™re able, please consider donating. Thereâ€™s also a question of whether t2bot.io should even be operating at this scale in the first place: Matrix is all about decentralization and owning your own conversations, which naturally means there should be many smaller bridges for communities or even a discord.com-provided bridge for everyone to use. For the time being though, t2bot.io is offered as a convenience and aims to adapt itself as needed to keep providing value.

Questions, concerns, etc are best discussed in [#help:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io) on Matrix. Nearly every detail of how t2bot.io works is intended to be shared openly, which includes the financial aspect of running the service, so ask away ðŸ™‚

Thanks,
TravisR, t2bot.io
