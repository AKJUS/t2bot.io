# sed(1) Bot

A bot to help you do sed-like replacements on messages.

This bot is powered by [maubot (GitHub)](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) through the [sed plugin (GitHub)](https://github.com/maubot/sed).


## Using the bot

1. Invite [@sed:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@sed:t2bot.io) to your room.
2. Send a message with a spelling error in it.
3. Say `s/wrong/right` to correct it, replacing `wrong` with the mispelling and `right` with the correct spelling.
