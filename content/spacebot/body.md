# Community to Space Conversion Bot

A utility bot for converting communities (groups) to Spaces. For more information
about Spaces (and the legacy Communities system), see the [Element Blog](https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/).

The bot's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/t2bot/groups-to-space-bot).

## Using the bot

1. DM [@spacebot:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@spacebot:t2bot.io)
2. Say `!convert +group:example.org` to start the conversion.
3. Give the bot a minute to figure things out.
4. You should receive an invite to your newly created Space, though your community members won't be invited.
5. Make any changes you like to the Space (it's yours).
6. Advertise the space within your community so people can join, or invite the people that need to be there.
