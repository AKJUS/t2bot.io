# Sticker Bot

Create your own sticker packs to share with others (or to keep to yourself). This requires an integration manager which supports custom sticker packs, such as [Dimension](https://dimension.t2bot.io/).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-sticker-manager).


## Using the bot

1. Invite [@stickers:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@stickers:t2bot.io) to a **private** chat.
2. Say `!stickers newpack` and follow the directions.
3. Open Dimension and edit your sticker packs.
4. Paste the URL the bot gave you into the "Add Sitcker Packs" box.
5. Click "Add Stickerpack"
