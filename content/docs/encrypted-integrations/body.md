Many bots on t2bot.io support end-to-end encryption, meaning they can see encrypted messages
in rooms where they are members. All of t2bot.io's bots will automatically ignore anything
that isn't relevant to them, though. For example, the [Trello bot](/trellobot) will discard
messages that don't have `!trello` at the start. Encryption does mean that nobody between
you and the bot, including us at t2bot.io, can see what you're saying. Your conversations
in encrypted rooms are between you, the other people in the room, and the bots.

The bots on t2bot.io can't currently be explicitly verified, however the public keys for each
bot are below if you'd like to manually verify them.
