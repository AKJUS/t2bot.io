*Last updated November 7th, 2020*

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the t2bot.io
community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to
providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct
to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the
community.

This code of conduct applies to conversation in any room within the t2bot.io community
and commits and comments relating to any project in the [t2bot](https://github.com/t2bot)
GitHub space. If "t2bot.io homeserver moderator"
([@abuse:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@abuse:t2bot.io)) is a member of the room, this
code of conduct applies to that room.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of
  all backgrounds and identities.
* **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
  depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues,
  and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember
  that we're a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's
  primary language.
* **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is not
  excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration
  now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's
  important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened
  is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose.** Be kind to others. Do not insult or put
  down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree.** Disgreements, both social and technical, happen
  all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
  constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of our community comes from
  its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
  perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint
  doesn't mean they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other
  doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
  mistakes.

# Definitions

Harassment is strictly not tolerated, and can include the following:

* Comments relating to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities,
  illnesses, appearance, region, political affiliation, religious affiliation, etc.
* Deliberate misgendering or deadnaming.
* Physical, simulated or otherwise, contact without consent or request to stop.
* Threats or incitement of violence of any kind, including encouraging suicide or
  self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation, including stalking and following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment
  purposes.
* Sustained distruption of conversation.
* Unwelcome sexual attention, including off-topic images or behaviour.
* Patterns of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate
  levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests cease.
* Deliberate outing of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent, unless
  needed to protect others from intentional abuse. Coercing someone to out themselves
  unwillingly is also not tolerated.
* Publication of private conversations without consent.

Complaints made to us must be:

* In good faith and not malicious in nature.
* Not regarding reasonable communication boundaries, such as someone saying "leave me
  alone" or "go away".
* Not regarding refusal to explain/debate social justice concepts.
* Not be regarding a perceived tone of conversation.
* Not be an attempt to incite oppressive behaviour, such as reporting someone for being
  of a particular identity.

# Diversity statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.
Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as
possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take
responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility
to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Though our list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly welcome anyone regardless of
identity, gender, age, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs,
profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical
ability. We will not tolerate discimination of any kind.

We take a position on acceptable behaviour for our community as defined by this code of
conduct. We will not endorse behaviour which is counter to this. We do not have a mandate
to promote content which is associated with an entity whose position is incompatible
with this code of conduct.

# Reporting issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please
report it by contacting [@travis:t2l.io](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) on Matrix.
All reports are handled with discretion. If your report relates to TravisR themselves,
please report it to [matrix.org under their code of conduct](https://matrix.org/legal/code-of-conduct#reporting-issues).

In your report, please include:

* Names of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include
  them as well.
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.
* The date and time of the incident (or just the start of the incident).
* Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, we will review the report, ask any questions we may have, and
make a decision on how to respond. We will follow up once the relevant action has been
taken against the accused, if any. We will not disclose who made a report without
consent.
