            Dimension is an open source integrations manager for Riot. What Dimension allows you to do is manage the
            various bots and bridges for your room, much like the default manager in Riot, but in a free and open
            source way. Currently t2bot.io has a version of Riot that uses Dimension running at <a href="https://t2bot.io/riot">t2bot.io/riot</a>.
            Simply log in and click the integrations button to give it a spin.
